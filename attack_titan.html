            <h2>Story of Attack Titan</h2>
                <h3>The Fall of Shiganshina arc</h3>
                    <P>After holding the Attack Titan for thirteen years, Wall Maria comes under attack by the Warriors of Marley,[12][13] and Grisha decides the time has come to negotiate with the Founding Titan or take it by force. Arriving at the Underground Chapel, Grisha pleads with Frieda Reiss for the sake of Eldia and the Walls, but his cries are neglected.[14][11] Left with no other choice, Grisha uses the Attack Titan against Frieda's Founding Titan and overpowers her, stealing her Founding Titan and killing her along with the rest of her family, excluding her father, who escapes.</P>
                    <p>That night, after Wall Maria's breach, Grisha reunites with his son. In tears and on the verge of hysteria, Grisha gives Eren the basement key and forces him to take an injection that causes him to lose his memories. As he is injecting Eren, he tells Eren that he must get to their basement, and that Eren must learn to control his power in order to save Mikasa's, Armin's, and everyone else's lives.[15] The injection causes Eren to transform into a Titan, and Grisha is devoured by his own son.[14]</P>
                <h3>The Strugle for Trost arc</h3>
                    <p>For five years, Eren Jaeger lived his life unaware of his possession of the power of the Titans until the year 850, during the struggle for Trost. Upon being caught and eaten by a Titan, Eren's injuries and burning desire to slaughter the Titans trigger his first transformation into his Titan form. In a nearly mindless state, Eren wanders Trost as a Titan, slaughtering many Titans throughout the day all while avoiding bringing harm to the human cadets around him. His Titan eventually exhausts itself, and Eren emerges with healed wounds.</p>
                <h3>The 57th Exterior Scounting Mission arc</h3>
                    <p>Some time afterward, Eren joins the Scout Regiment after his change of custody is made official in a military tribunal.[19] During his first month in the Scouts, the Attack Titan is subjected to a variety of studies by Section Commander Hange ZoÃ«. At this time, the Scout Regiment discovers the dependency of the Titan's power upon a fixed goal in mind before transformation in addition to the drawing of blood.[20] After the month's passing, the Scout Regiment sets out on the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. However, the scouting mission is sabotaged by the arrival of the Female Titan.[21] Within a Forest of Giant Trees, the Attack Titan battles the Female Titan, but he is defeated.[22] While Eren is later rescued from the Female Titan, the scouting mission is cut short and is considered a failure.</p>
